## Overview
The code for paper [Training Multimedia Event Extraction With Generated Images and Captions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.08966.pdf).


## Requirements

You can install the environment using `requirements.txt` for each component.

```pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data

Visual event extraction data can be downloaded from [imSitu](http://imsitu.org/).
Textual event extraction data can be downloaded from [ACE](https://www.ldc.upenn.edu/).
We preprcoess data following [UniCL](https://github.com/jianliu-ml/Multimedia-EE) and [JMEE](https://github.com/lx865712528/EMNLP2018-JMEE/tree/master).


## Quickstart

### Generating data

(1) Generating Images
```
python Data/image_generator.py 
```
(2) Generating Captions
```
python Data/image_captioner.py 
```

### Training

(0) Data Preprocessing
```
python Data/object_detector.py 
```

Please specify the data paths, checpoint paths, output paths, and round (`decouple`, `round1`, and  `CKPT` `CKPT_OUTPUT`, `Event_Output_Path`) in the code. 

(1) Event Extraction
```
python Training/event_train.py 
```

(2) Argument Extraction
```
python Training/T_arg_train.py 
python Training/V_arg_train.py 
```

(3) Multimodal
```
python Training/mmee.py 
```
